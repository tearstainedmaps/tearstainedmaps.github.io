          <h4><a href="http://geocommunity.net/projects.htm">Logging Scars: Quantifying the industrially impacted boreal forest of Ontario</a></h4>
          <p>The Wildlands League has an ongoing project that has been examining the extent to which commercial forestry 
            in Northern Ontario has had a lasting impact on the landscape. Currently, logging activities are managed under the 
            assumption ~1% of the areas logged are lost to road footprints. However current work indicated this number seriously 
            underestimates the extent of the logging scars of roads and roadside impacts. Our proof of concept work estimates 
            that this number is closer to 10-15%. </p>

          <p>Taking the existing various sources (paper, digital, studies), create a wastewater network model with the goal of looking for opportunities to improve its flow rates and elevations on maintenance. For example, in years time when they replace a pipe section they can know to raise it to have better gravity flow and capacity. The data model created will be provided to the municipality and to the Ganaraska Conservation Authority to be housed in Geocortex. 
            A demo Geocortex site can be created to permit a more easily transferred into the GRCA site.</p>

          <p>The purpose of an interactive, lightweight online GIS application/WebMap is to provide NEC (Niagara Escarpment Commission) staff with relevant information in a quick and easy to use package that they can bring up in a web browser when taking inquiry calls or working from home.
            The Collector field app will allow compliance officers to view NEC map layers, and collect information in the field.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://geocommunity.net/projects.htm">Food Insecurity in Ontario by Electoral Riding</a></h4>
          <p>The Ontario Association of Food Banks is a network of 130 direct member food banks, and over 1,100 
            affiliate hunger-relief agencies across the province. Together, our network serves over half a million 
            adults, children and seniors every year. Hunger differs significantly across the province, for a wide 
            variety of reasons (lack of suitable employment, environmental factors, remote community location, cost 
            of living, etc.). It is our hope that, through this project, we will be able learn more about hunger at 
            the local level and, in turn, identify strategies for reaching and serving those who need food assistance 
            and support throughout the year. It is also our hope that by mapping food bank use by electoral district it 
            will support our advocacy objectives at Queen's Park by better informing Members of Provincial Parliament 
            about hunger and poverty in their constituencies.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://geocommunity.net/projects.htm">Developing GIS communication tools for Flood Risk in the GTA</a></h4>
          <p>This project involves the creation of a state of the art web-based communication tool to communicate river-related geospatial flood 
            risk information (flood extents, depths, velocities, threat to loss of life, impacted buildings and roads, etc.) 
            to the public in an educational, interactive, intuitive, and visually appealing manner. At locations where data is
             available, the website would link to measured water levels at our real-time stream gauge locations to allow users
              to view near-realtime geospatial flood risk information. Spatial analysis of geospatial data may be required to 
              create interpolated layers in-between known flood extents at known water surface elevations. GIS statistical 
              analysis may be required to provide educational summary statistics at flood-vulnerable clusters.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://geocommunity.net/projects.htm"> Forestry Searching for habitat associations of foraging bats across Ontario landscapes</a></h4>
          <p>White-nose syndrome (WNS) has caused high mortality in eastern North American bats. 
            Wind facilities may further threaten bat populations. To assess these impacts, mortality 
            counts must be considered in relation to population size, but reliable population estimates 
            for Ontario's 8 bat species do not exist. To establish a baseline for the current distribution, 
            abundance and foraging habitats of bats, mobile acoustic transects have been run across the province 
            using randomly selected locations stratified by ecoregion. Bat echolocation calls are recorded along each 
            route while driving at 32 km/hr. These high frequency calls can often be identified to species and this 
            speed allows the separation of individual bats. This project will focus on determining the key foraging 
            habitats of bats using this data and whether these habitats differ between bat species and between northern 
            and southern Ontario.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://geocommunity.net/projects.htm">Clarington Development Applications Dashboard</a></h4>
          <p>Clarington currently operates a basic Development Applications Portal for planners and staff 
            to review current planning applications in Municipality. This basic portal needs to be re-invented 
            into a fully functional Geospatial Portal that allows planners and staff to map their own applications 
            as oppose to GIS being needed to map them. A dashboard (operations dashboard perhaps) that gives a quick
             view on where applications are, there status and other statistics would be ideal. This portal would have 
             three functions: 1. To view current applications, pull statistics/reports from them and make decisions 
             based on the information given, 2. Allow planners to add spatial extents to their applications without 
             the need of a GIS staff member and 3. Ensure background database quality control, via several check and
              balances. </p>
